ðŸ‘‹ Hi there I'm Daniele Siri and I'm a humble programmer who knows he will never know enough about one technology.

<h1>About me</h1>
I started being interested in Computers in my early age, and the older I got the more curious I got about programming and technologies in general. What drives me is being able to know my stuff and share it to other people.

My strong trait is that I don't stop until I've solved the problem at hand, going deep into research if I don't know the answer or implementing what I know until I've reached a good level of satisfaction.
